# Rock, Paper, Scissors 

**<u>Synopsis</u>**

For this project, I created a game of rock, paper, scissors using the random module in python. When the user is done playing the game, they will be able to view the total number of games they've won compared to the computer.

**<u>Inspiration</u>**

This project was inspired by the programmer Tim Ruscica, also known as Tech With Tim.
